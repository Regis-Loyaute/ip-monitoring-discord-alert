This script is a simple IP monitoring tool that pings a specified IP address and sends a message to a Discord channel via webhook when the IP goes down or comes back up. It also logs the events in a file called ip_monitor.log. Let's break down the script into its components:

Import necessary libraries:

time, requests, and datetime are standard Python libraries.
ping3 is an external library for ICMP ping. You can install it using pip install ping3 if you haven't already.
logging is a standard Python library for logging messages.
Set up variables:

ip_address: The target IP address to monitor.
webhook_url: The Discord webhook URL for sending messages to a specific channel.
last_ping_time: The timestamp of the last successful ping.
is_up: A flag indicating whether the IP is currently up or down.
Configure logging:

The logger is set up with a name, level, and formatter.
A file handler is created to log messages to a file named ip_monitor.log.
The file handler is added to the logger.
Define the send_webhook_message function:

This function sends a message to the Discord webhook URL.
It logs the success or failure of the webhook request.
Main loop:

The script enters an infinite loop, continuously pinging the target IP address.
If the ping is successful and the IP was previously down, it calculates the downtime, sends a webhook message, and updates the last_ping_time and is_up variables.
If the ping fails and the IP was previously up, it sends a webhook message and updates the is_up variable.
The loop has no delay, which means it will continuously ping the target IP address without any pause. To reduce the load on the system and network, you can add a delay using time.sleep(seconds).
